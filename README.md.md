## Project Overview
A simple JavaScript quiz game that runs in the browser console.  
The quiz uses a predefined array of question objects, prompts the user for answers using `prompt()`, gives immediate feedback with `alert()`, normalizes input using `toLowerCase()` and `trim()`, tracks the score, and displays the final result.

## Features
- Uses arrays, loops (`for`), conditionals (`if/else`), and functions.
- Input normalization with `toLowerCase()` and `trim()`.
- Immediate feedback for each question.
- Final score and percentage displayed at the end.
- No HTML or DOM required — runs entirely via prompt/alert in the browser.

## Files
- `quiz.js` — main quiz script. Paste into the browser console or link in a simple HTML file to run.

## How to run
### Run directly in browser console (recommended)
1. Open any webpage (or `about:blank`).
2. Open Developer Tools (F12 / Ctrl+Shift+I) and go to the Console tab.
3. Paste the full contents of `quiz.js` into the console and press Enter.
4. The quiz will start with prompt boxes.
